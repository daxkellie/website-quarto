## Playlists

I make several Spotify playlists. You might like to listen to them sometime:

:::{.column-page}

```{r}
create_proj_card(
  img_src = "images/design_1.jpg",
  url = "https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2lu6BzKSxy9UJU6l59tD3a?si=8c2875f5ac4a4b76",
  title = "Sixtape",
  text = "A 6-song mixtape, updated weekly. Every week each mixtape has a new genre or theme",
  text2 = NULL
)
create_proj_card(
  img_src = "images/design_2.jpg",
  url = "https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4kygq8zI5lP9ErsYOwECCh?si=6759bc73d34e4416",
  title = "The Complete Collection \nof Sixtapes",
  text = "All previous Sixtape playlists in one convenient place (and in order). For those who want to find an old song or love a long playlist to put on shuffle",
  text2 = NULL
)
```
