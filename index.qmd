I'm a data analyst and science lead at the [Atlas of Living Australia](https://www.ala.org.au/), based near Sydney, NSW. I'm also an evolutionary biologist, with a PhD in evolutionary biology and social psychology. I value scientific transparency and reproducibility. I try to implement these practices as much as I can. Passionate about music. Love all genres. I play piano sometimes.
